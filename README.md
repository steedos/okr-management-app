## About  Steedos Platform

Steedos Platform is a visual modeling and descriptive programming development tool. The design goal is to lower the threshold of application construction so that everyone can participate in the development. The system has built-in data modeling and a series of automatic tools, including validation rules, public computing, workflow rules, automatic operation, approval process, report engine and so on.

## Requirements

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/) version >= 3.4. MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 10.15.1 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running `yarn version`). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the `npm` client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.
